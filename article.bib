abstract = {We propose a comprehensive statistical approach describing the penetration depth of light in random media. The presented theory exploits the concept of probability density function f(z|$\rho$, t) for the maximum depth reached by the photons that are eventually re-emitted from the surface of the medium at distance $\rho$ and time t. Analytical formulas for f, for the mean maximum depth 〈zmax〉 and for the mean average depth 〈z〉 reached by the detected photons at the surface of a diffusive slab are derived within the framework of the diffusion approximation to the radiative transfer equation, both in the time domain and the continuous wave domain. Validation of the theory by means of comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations is also presented. The results are of interest for many research fields such as biomedical optics, advanced microscopy and disordered photonics.},

abstract = {We report a simple add-on for broadband stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopes to enable fast and programmable spectroscopy acquisition. It comprises a conventional dispersive spectrometer layout incorporating a fast digital micromirror device (DMD). The approach is validated by acquiring SRS spectra of standard chemicals. We demonstrate a DMD's advantage in broadband SRS by showing higher signal-to-noise ratio using a multiplexed Hadamard spectral basis and compressive sensing detection. Our results apply to a variety of frequency-domain pump-probe spectroscopy.},

@article{Martelli2016,
abstract = {A set of time-domain analytical forward solvers for Raman signals detected from homogeneous diffusive media is presented. The time-domain solvers have been developed for two geometries: the parallelepiped and the finite cylinder. The potential presence of a background fluorescence emission, contaminating the Raman signal, has also been taken into account. All the solvers have been obtained as solutions of the time dependent diffusion equation. The validation of the solvers has been performed by means of comparisons with the results of “gold standard” Monte Carlo simulations. These forward solvers provide an accurate tool to explore the information content encoded in the time-resolved Raman measurements.},

@article{Sekar2017,
abstract = {We present a new technique, frequency offset Raman spectroscopy (FORS), to probe Raman spectra of diffusive media in depth. The proposed methodology obtains depth sensitivity exploiting changes in optical properties (absorption and scattering) with excitation wavelengths. The approach was demonstrated experimentally on a two-layer tissue phantom and compared with the already consolidated spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) technique. FORS attains a similar enhancement of signal from deep layers as SORS, namely 2.81 against 2.62, while the combined hybrid FORS-SORS approach leads to a markedly higher 6.0 enhancement. Differences and analogies between FORS and SORS are discussed, suggesting FORS as an additional or complementary approach for probing heterogeneous media such as biological tissues in depth.},

abstract = {We present a time domain diffuse Raman spectrometer for depth probing of highly scattering media. The system is based on, to the best of our knowledge, a novel time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) camera that simultaneously acquires both spectral and temporal information of Raman photons. A dedicated non-contact probe was built, and time domain Raman measurements were performed on a tissue mimicking bilayer phantom. The fluorescence contamination of the Raman signal was eliminated by early time gating (0&#x2013;212&#x00A0;ps) the Raman photons. Depth sensitivity is achieved by time gating Raman photons at different delays with a gate width of 106&#x00A0;ps. Importantly, the time domain can provide time-dependent depth sensitivity leading to a high contrast between two layers of Raman signal. As a result, an enhancement factor of 2170 was found for our bilayer phantom which is much higher than the values obtained by spatial offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS), frequency offset Raman spectroscopy (FORS), or hybrid FORS-SORS on a similar phantom.},
